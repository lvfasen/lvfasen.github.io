## git  push 失败解决方法

git push报错

```html
ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: No address associated with hostname
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```



1）ssh验证

```html
ssh -T git@github.com
ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: No address associated with hostname

```

2）ping测试

```html
ping github.com
Ping request could not find host github.com. Please check the name and try again.

```

3）修改host文件

```html
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
140.82.113.4    github.com
```
